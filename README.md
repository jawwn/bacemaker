The BaceMaker Foot Synth

Uses the Mozzi Library: http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/

Output on Pin 9, be sure to connect your preferred resistors so it's not ridiculously loud! 10K to ground should do it.

The Input pins use INPUT_PULLUP, so the other end of your switch will go to ground, as we're detecting a LOW signal.

This project assumes you are using a foot pedal that has 13 pedals, starting and ending with C.

Foot combinations:

Bottom C and D held together, enter into Oscillator Settings

While holding C1 and D:

Db - Main Octave Down

Eb - Main Octave Up
  ( Default is Octave 2 )
  
E - Toggle Octave 2 - Detuned

F - Toggle Octave 3

G - Toggle Octave 4

A - Toggle Octave 5

B - Toggle Octave 6

Gb - Toggle Sine Wave in Main Octave

Ab - Toggle Square Wave in Main Octave

Bb - Toggle Saw Wave in Main Octave

B and C2 Held together, enter into FX settings

While holding B and C2:

D - Toggle Tremolo

Db - Tremolo Speed Down

Eb - Tremolo Speed Up

Settings are saved in the EEPROM when changed, so they'll restore when you turn on the Bacemaer.

When initializing the newly uploaded Bacemaker, you have to reset your Oscillator and FX settings to get any sound.
